# [Andrew Weisbeck Resume](https://andrewweisbeck.com)

Welcome to my resume website! This is where you can get an overview of my experience, skills, projects I've worked on, and where you can find me on social media.

This website is meant to be just my resume and is not my main portfolio website - that is [GeauxWeisbeck4.dev](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev). You will want to head over there if you want a much cooler experience and to get a little more personal with me.

You can print the resume from here - just follow the instructions on the site!
